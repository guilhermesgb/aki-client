This was a class project, my very first real experience developing Android applications. But since I was still learning at the time, there's a huge room for improvement, specially in terms of better practices that could be applied to better structure and organize the codebase.

Aki is merely the codename for this project. This repo contains the Android client source code.

The backend, whose codebase is much better organized, was build using Flask and is located here: https://github.com/guilhermesgb/aki-server.

Sometime this year I plan to rebuild this Android client from scratch.
